The other four percent contains 75 known substances including Vitamins A, B, C, and E; calcium; amino acids for protein building; and enzymes used in the digestive system. There are over 240 species of aloe. However, only three or four of them have medicinal properties. The most potent one is aloe barbadensis.

In fact, there is evidence that as long as 4,500 years ago, neem was already being used to support healing.1 Its use originated in ancient India and neighboring countries, where it has long been revered as one of the most versatile plants known. Even today, the neem tree is esteemed as the “Village Dispensary”—every part of it known to possess unique therapeutic value.2 The neem tree belongs to the family meliaceae—the mahogany family—and is a fast-growing, evergreen tree well known for its drought resistance. The neem tree matures into a large shade tree with a dense, round canopy and can live for 150-200 years. And while neem is notorious for its strong unpleasant odor, its flowers have a delicious honey-like scent that can be smelled for miles. As a fast-growing tree that needs little water, neem is also a very renewable resource. In Ayurveda, neem is typically used to balance pitta and kapha. Its cold, light, and dry qualities tend to aggravate vata. Neem is therefore often recommended in combination with other herbs that help subdue its vata-provoking nature.
